JS-Xtract is a feature extraction library built in JavaScript. The library is based upon a previous library, LibXtract[1], which defined several functions for the C langauge.

## How to use it

JS-Xtract is self contained inside one file called jsXtract.min.js. Simply add this file your document header function, as shown below, to load the entire feature extraction library.

```html
<script src="jsXtract.min.js"></script>
```

Whilst the library has not been tested inside Node.js, it is built using ECMA Script version 5 and should be interpreted correctly, however your mileage will vary.
